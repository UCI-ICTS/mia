		<h2>SUMMARY OF KEY INFORMATION:</h2>
		<p>The information provided in this box includes a brief yet
			complete summary of key information about the research, presented first as
			required by the federal regulations. Some sections that require additional
			information may be repeated later in this document.</p>
		<h2>Participation is Voluntary</h2>
		<p>We are inviting you to be part of a research study at the
			University of California, Irvine (UCI). Taking part in this study is your
			choice. You can choose to take part or you can choose not to take part in this
			study. You also can change your mind about participating at any time. Whatever
			choice you make, you will not lose access to your medical care or give up any
			legal rights or benefits. To help you decide if you would like to participate,
			we want you to know why we are doing the study, what you will be expected to
			do, and the possible risks and benefits of being in the study. This form has
			information to help you make your choice about whether or not to participate.</p>
		<h2>Study Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this research study is to better understand
			how differences in genetic material affect human health.</p>
		<h2>Study Procedures</h2>
		<p>When you enroll in this study, you will be asked to provide
			detailed medical history and family health history information. If you had
			previous genetic testing, you will be asked to provide the data from this
			testing by asking for this data from the performing lab or allowing a member of
			our study team to request this data for you. You may be asked to provide a
			genetic sample. This may include blood or saliva. The study team will use
			multiple different approaches to find genetic changes which may cause human
			disease and other traits and better understand genetic changes with unclear
			meaning. Study staff will contact you and your doctor if they identify
			something that might explain your medical history.</p>
		<h2>Expected Duration</h2>
		<p>Participation will last approximately 1.5 hours and will
			include 1 visit on campus for a blood draw or saliva collection at home.</p>

		<h2>Risks of Participation</h2>
		<p>It is possible that the extensive genetic analysis may
			identify unexpected genetic results that have the potential to pose a present
			or future risk to your health. This may cause anxiety. Another risk is loss of
			confidentiality of your study information. Your samples will be assigned a
			study ID number to help minimize this risk. If a blood sample is obtained, this
			may cause risks including discomfort and/or bruising; infection, excess
			bleeding, clotting, or fainting. There may be minimal discomfort in obtaining a
			saliva sample due to pressure in the mouth from the swab.</p>
		<h2>Benefits to Participants</h2>
		<p>You may not receive any benefit from participating in this
			study. One possible benefit is receiving a genetic diagnosis</p>

		<h2>Benefits to Others or Society</h2>
		<p>Your information may help increase our knowledge of genetic
			syndromes and eventually lead to more effective diagnoses, management and
			treatment.</p>

		<h2>Alternative Procedures or Treatments</h2>
		<p>The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is to
			get advice from their doctor. This advice may include other options for genetic
			testing.</p>

		<p>If you are interested in learning more about this study,
			please continue reading below. The rest of this form gives you more important
			information you need to know about the study before you decide if you want to
			participate. The study doctor or a member of the research team will talk to you
			about the study and answer all of your questions. We encourage you to discuss
			this study with your family and anyone else you trust before making your
			decision. It's important that you have as much information as you need and that
			all your questions are answered.</p>
		<h2>WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?</h2>
		<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary.</p>

		<p>There will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are
			otherwise entitled if you decide not to be in the study or withdraw from the
			study later. This means that:</p>

		<p>You do not have to join the study. You may change your mind
			and stop being in the study at any time. We will tell you if we make any
			important changes to the study or if there are any important new findings so
			that you can decide if you still want to be in the study. If you are an
			employee or a medical or graduate student in training at UCI, your decision to
			participate or not participate will not affect your employment or academic
			standing.</p>

		<p>You are being asked to be in the study because you or your
			family member have a known or suspected genetic trait. Genetic traits are
			features or diseases due to variants in genetic material. Genetic material has
			the instructions in the body on how to grow and develop. There are many genetic
			traits that do not have a known cause. Some people have genetic testing to try
			and explain why they have a disease. Some genetic tests do not find an answer.
			Some genetic tests report an uncertain result. We want to see if newer genetic
			testing tools can find an answer for people who do not find an answer on
			standard genetic tests. </p>
		<p>We also want to identify new genes that cause human disease.</p>

		<p>We want to also find a better way to determine if an
			uncertain genetic result causes a disease.</p>

		<p>Dr. Eric Vilain is the person responsible for this research
			study at UCI. He is called the Principal Investigator.</p>

		<p>The study team may work with other companies that provide
			clinical genetic testing for research or commercially. The National Human
			Genome Research Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is paying
			for this research to be done.</p>
		<h2>Â </h2>
		<h2>REQUEST FOR STORAGE AND SHARING OF RESEARCH DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</h2>
		<p>Genomic studies, including genome-wide association studies
			(GWAS), examine genetic differences in the entire human genome (the complete
			set of human genes) and the association between these genetic differences and
			health conditions.</p>

		<p>As part of this study, we will collect information about your
			health and your individual genes. This information may be stored scientific
			data repositories at UCI, at another UC campus, or be sent to a National
			Institutes of Health (NIH)-designated data repository that includes all kinds
			of genomic data from studies funded by the NIH. The information may also be
			maintained by private companies and other institutions.</p>

		<p>The aim of collecting this information may be to look for
			genetic connections that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				may increase the likelihood of getting a certain disease (such as asthma, diabetes, heart
				disease, cancer or mental illness) or a condition (such as high blood pressure
				or obesity); may affect the progress of a certain disease or condition; or</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				may affect treatments (medicines, etc.) that work for certain diseases in some people, but
				not in others.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Your individual genomic data and health information will be
			put in a controlled-access data repository. This means that only researchers
			who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research
			project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data and health
			information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could
			be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the
			repository must agree not to attempt to identify you.</p>

		<h2>HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>This study will involve up to 4,200 people. This will include
			patients with known or suspected genetic traits and their relatives, such as
			parents and siblings. We expect half of the participants to be patients and
			family members recruited at UCI. We expect half of the participants to be
			patients and family members to be referred from outside of UCI.</p>

		<h2>AM I ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility
			criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better
			understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study
			team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you
			qualify for participation in this study.</p>
		<h2>Inclusion Requirements:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can participate in this study if you are someone with an undiagnosed genetic condition.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Exclusion Requirements:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You cannot participate in this study if you already have a genetic diagnosis.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY GO ON?</h2>
		<p>This study includes 1 vist on campus for a blood draw or
			saliva collection at home and will take apporximently 1.5 hours to complete.</p>

		<h2>WHAT PROCEDURES ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>If you decide to participate in the research, you will be
			asked to provide clinical information and samples for genetic testing. A
			summary of the study procedures is included below:</p>

		<p>You will be assigned a unique study ID number. We will
			request you provide the study team with detailed medical and family history
			information. When available, study staff will review your medical records at
			UCI. Study staff may request you provide copies of additional medical records.
			Study staff will request you provide genetic data from previous genetic
			testing. The study team will use research computer tools to reanalyze this
			data. Study staff may request you provide a blood sample (up to 2 teaspoons or
			10 mL) to collect DNA and RNA and protein. DNA is what stores genetic material
			in the body. RNA is made using the instruction in DNA. Protein is made using
			instructions in RNA. Study staff may request a cheek swab or a saliva sample to
			collect genetic material. Blood draws and cheek swabs will be collected in one
			of following ways:</p>

		<p>You may schedule a collection at the UCI research unit. If
			you are having clinical blood collection for another reason, an extra sample
			may be collected for this study. Study team may be able to arrange for someone
			to come to your home to collect a blood sample if needed. This sample
			collection may be obtained through one of University of California, Irvine's
			national phlebotomy contacts. If you provide a buccal sample, these will be
			collected either on site or with a kit provided to you with instructions for
			collection at home and mailing back. There are no other required interactions
			with the study. A team of study investigators will review your case history and
			genetic results. This team will determine what research tests will be performed
			on your samples and data. Your sample may be used for a variety of genetic
			testing including, but not limited to, Whole Genome Sequencing, Optical
			Mapping, and RNA sequencing. These are different ways of looking at your
			genetic material. Certain genetic variants may be used in specific studies to
			test if the variant is likely to cause a genetic trait. If the study team
			requires additional information to better understand a variant found in your
			testing, the team may contact you to request additional information about your
			medical history and/or an additional blood or saliva sample. After enrollment,
			you may decline to provide any additional information or samples and still
			participate in the study. If the study team identifies a genetic change that is
			believed to be medically important, the team will contact you and your doctor
			to discuss the research result. This may include genetic variants known to
			cause disease or genetic variants that cannot clearly be classified as
			"disease-causing" or "benign". A genetic counselor or
			clinical geneticist on the study team will be able to discuss these results
			with you. Research results will need to be confirmed in a clinical lab. </p>

		<h2>RETURN OF RESULTS</h2>
		<p>You will not be provided the clinical information collected
			for this research study. Complete genetic data will not be provided to you. You
			will be notified of genetic variants that the study team believe are medically
			important. A genetic counselor or clinical geneticist on the study team will be
			available to discuss these results with you. No clinical report will be
			generated from the study. If you need a clinical report for your medical care,
			separate clinical testing to confirm research findings will not be paid for by
			the study. You or your insurance will need to pay for that testing.</p>

		<h2>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OR RISKS RELATED TO THE STUDY?</h2>

		<p>Risks and side effects related to the blood draw include
			those which are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Blood draw: Removing blood by a needle may cause temporary pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling,
				dizziness, and on rare instances fainting or infection.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS): WGS generates an extremely large amount of information about
				people, including factors that will contribute to their future medical
				conditions. It can provide insight into the health of individuals and their
				biological family. It is possible that WGS data gathered for one purpose could
				reveal important information, perhaps unanticipated and unplanned for, years
				later.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				It is possible that the extensive genetic analysis may identify unexpected genetic results
				that have the potential to pose a present or future risk to your health. This
				may cause anxiety. Another risk is loss of confidentiality of your study
				information. Your samples will be assigned a study ID number to help minimize
				this risk. If a blood sample is obtained, this may cause risks including
				discomfort and/or bruising; infection, excess bleeding, clotting, or fainting.
				There may be minimal discomfort in obtaining a saliva sample due to pressure in
				the mouth from the swab.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				There may be
				risks to your privacy and the privacy of your relatives from storing your
				information in the repository. Although the data repository have robust
				procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of the stored information,
				we do not know how likely it is that your identity could become re-connected
				with your genetic and health information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				We will do everything we can to protect your information but
				we cannot absolutely guarantee your privacy or predict how genetic information
				will be used in the future. People may develop ways in the future that would
				allow someone to link your genetic or medical information back to you. For
				example, someone could compare information in a data repository with
				information from you (or a family member) in another database and be able to
				identify you (or a relative). It is also possible that there could be violations
				to the security of the computer systems used to share the codes linking your
				genetic and medical information to you. There may be other privacy risks that
				we have not foreseen.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				If your genetic information were re-identified, personal
				information about you, your health, and your risk of disease could become known
				to others which could potentially have a negative impact or unintended
				consequences for you and/or your family. A federal law called the Genetic
				Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) will help protect you from genetic
				discrimination in health insurance and employment. GINA does not protect you
				against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance,
				or long-term care insurance. It also does not prohibit discrimination on the
				basis of already known genetic disease. For more information about GINA go to
				http://www.genome.gov/10002077.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>ARE THERE BENEFITS TO PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY?</h2>
		<p>There is no direct benefit to you from placing your genetic
			information in the repository. Allowing researchers to study your genetic
			information may lead to a better understanding of how genes affect health. This
			may help other people in the future.</p>

		<h2>WILL I BE PAID FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<h2>Compensation</h2>
		<p>You will not be compensated for your participation in this
			research study.</p>
		<h2>Reimbursement</h2>
		<p>You will not receive reimbursement for any out of pocket
			expenses, such as parking or transportation fees.</p>

		<p>Your information and samples (both identifiable and
			de-identified) may be used to help researchers create products or to deliver
			services, including some that may be sold and/or make money for others. If this
			happens, there are no plans to tell you or to pay you or your family.</p>

		<h2>WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>There are no costs to you or to your insurance company for
			taking part in this study. The study will pay for all research genetic testing
			and collection of samples for the study. If a genetic variant is identified
			that is clinically important, you or your insurance will have to pay for
			clinical testing to confirm the variant is present. You or your insurance
			company will have to pay for the costs of any routine or standard medical care
			that is not part of the study. This includes standard of care testing that is
			performed based on genetic diagnoses or variants identified by this study. This
			may include, but is not limited to, visits to the clinic, having to stay in the
			hospital, laboratory tests, x-rays, or other tests. If your insurance company
			does not pay for the routine or standard care, you will be responsible for
			paying for it.</p>

		<h2>WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED BECAUSE I TOOK PART IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>It is important that you promptly tell the researchers if you
			believe that you have been injured because of taking part in this study. You
			can tell the researcher in person or call them at the number listed at the top
			of this form.</p>
		<p>If you are injured as a result of being in this study, UCI
			will provide necessary medical treatment. The costs of the treatment may be
			covered by the University of California, or billed to you or your insurer just
			like other medical costs, depending on a number of factors.</p>
		<p>The University and the study sponsor do not normally provide
			any other form of compensation for injury. For more information about this, you
			may call UCI Human Research Protections (949) 824-8170 or by e-mail at
			IRB@research.uci.edu</p>

		<h2>WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STOP TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</h2>
		<p>You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you
			decide to withdraw from this study, you should notify the research team
			immediately. The research team may also end your participation in this study if
			you do not follow instructions, miss scheduled visits, the study sponsor
			decides to stop the study or your safety and welfare are at risk.</p>

		<p>If you experience any of the side effects listed above, if
			your health worsens, or if you are injured during the research, you may need to
			be withdrawn from the study, even if you would like to continue. The research
			team will make this decision and let you know if it is not possible for you to
			continue. The decision may be made to protect your safety and welfare, or
			because the research plan does not allow people who develop certain conditions
			to continue to participate.</p>

		<p>If you elect to withdraw or are withdrawn from this research
			study, you may choose to terminate the continued use or disclosure of your
			protected health information (PHI) for research purposes. The request to end
			the use or disclosure of your PHI should be made in writing.</p>

		<p>You are free to withdraw your consent to use your
			identifiable private information and biospecimen for future research at any
			time however there are some limitations. If you withdraw your consent, the
			researchers will not use your information or biospecimens in future research
			studies. However, any of your information or biospecimens already being used in
			a research study that began before your request to withdraw will continue to be
			used for that specific study. Also if information and biospecimens have already
			been provided to another researcher, institution, or company, it may not be
			possible to limit their continued and new uses.</p>

		<p>You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you
			decide to withdraw from this study, you should notify the research team
			immediately. Please note that any information already distributed for research
			cannot be retrieved.</p>

		<h2>HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND MY PARTICIPATION BE KEPT?</h2>
		<h2>Participant Identifiable Data</h2>
		<p>Identifiable information collected about you will be removed
			and replaced with a code. A list linking the code and your identifiable
			information will be kept separate from the research data.</p>
		<h2>Data Storage</h2>
		<p>Research data will be stored electronically on a secure
			network in an encrypted file with password protection. </p>
		<h2>Data Retention</h2>
		<p>The researchers intend to store your research data and/or
			biospecimens in a repository indefinitely. The researchers may continue to use
			and share your information and information obtained from analyses of your
			biospecimens indefinitely. Also the use and sharing of your identifiable
			biospecimens will continue until the specimens are gone.</p>

		<h2>WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MY STUDY DATA?</h2>
		<p>The research team, authorized UCI personnel, and regulatory
			entities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Office of Human
			Research Protections (OHRP), may have access to your study records to protect
			your safety and welfare.</p>
		<p>While the research team will make every effort to keep your
			personal information confidential, it is possible that an unauthorized person
			might see it. We cannot guarantee total privacy.</p>

		<h2>Future Research Use</h2>
		<p>Researchers will use your specimens and information to
			conduct this study. Once the study is done using your specimens and
			information, we may share them with other researchers so they can use them for
			other studies in the future. We will not share your name or any other private
			identifiable information that would let the researchers know who you are. We
			will not ask you for additional permission to share this de-identified
			information.</p>

		<h2>Certificate of Confidentiality</h2>
		<p>To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a
			Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ).
			With this Certificate, researchers cannot be forced to disclose information
			that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal,
			administrative, legislative, or other proceedings or be used as evidence, for
			example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use.
			Information, documents, or biospecimens protected by this Certificate cannot be
			disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if
			there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to
			report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or
			local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see
			below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical
			treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by
			federal regulations protecting research subjects.</p>

		<p>The Certificate cannot be used to refuse a request for
			information from personnel of the United States federal or state government
			agency sponsoring the project that is needed for auditing or program evaluation
			by the NIH which is funding this project or for information that must be
			disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug
			Administration (FDA). You should understand that a Certificate of
			Confidentiality does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing information
			about yourself or your involvement in this research. If you want your research
			information released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person
			not connected with the research, you must provide consent to allow the
			researchers to release it.</p>

		<h2>ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY? </h2>
		<h2>Use of Biospecimens</h2>
		<p>Biospecimens (such as blood, tissue, or saliva) collected
			from you for this study and/or information obtained from your biospecimens may
			be used in this research or other research, and shared with other
			organizations. You will not share in any commercial value or profit derived
			from the use of your biospecimens and/or information obtained from them.</p>
		<h2>Genetics</h2>
		<p>In the event of an unexpected breach of confidentiality, a
			federal law called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) will
			help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on
			genetic information obtained about you. In California, state law (CalGINA)
			requires that employers with 5 or more employees may not use your genetic
			information, obtained from this research when making a decision to hire,
			promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.</p>

		<p>GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an
			already manifest genetic disease or disorder. This means if you have a
			diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer
			may use the information to determine eligibility or rates. Also, GINA does not
			protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life
			insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.</p>

		<p>If you would like more information about the federal GINA law
			go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf
			or CalGINA:

		<h2>Banking of Tissue Specimens:</h2>
		<p>We would like to store tissue specimens collected from you in
			this study in a tissue bank for future research as identified below. The
			specimens consist of your genetic material including DNA, RNA, or protein, or
			cells. The tissue bank is maintained by the study team at UCI.</p>

		<p>You may change your mind at a later time and request that
			your sample be destroyed. If you change your mind and want to request that your
			sample be destroyed, you may do this by contacting our study team in writing.</p>

		<h2>Primary Findings</h2>
		<p>This study will attempt to find genetic changes that are
			related to your medical history. If we find a genetic change that we believe is
			related to disease, we plan to tell you about it. Research genetic findings
			will need to be confirmed in a clinical lab before they can be returned to your
			medical record. For some of these genetic changes we may not be able to say it
			definitely is "disease causing" or benign. If you do not want us to
			communicate any genetic results to you, you have the option below.</p>

		<h2>Secondary Findings</h2>
		<p>Sometimes genetic testing finds medically important variants
			that are not related to the reason for the testing. These are called secondary
			findings. These may relate to disease risks you may not know about. This
			includes things like risk for cancer and risk for heart disease. In some cases,
			secondary findings might change your doctor's treatment plan. These are called
			medically actionable findings. This may include increased screening tests or
			specific medicines.</p>

		<p>We do not specifically look for secondary findings in this
			study, but may find these during the course of our analysis.</p>
